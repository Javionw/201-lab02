        I also love to workout and play basketball. I graduated from Bolton Highschool in 2018, and
        I'm now enrolled in a fast paced coding course called "CodeCrew." I have many years of experience
        working in retail, and warehouses. Ranging from my first job as a cashier at kroger in 2018 to my 
        most recent job as a Amazon warehouse associate in 2021. I also went back to kroger as an overnight
        stocker in 2022 for a while until I found out about these courses. Goals that i have include graduating
        CodeCrew and finding a job in software engineering / developing. My main end goal is to one day 
        design and engineer my own video game for youtubers and streamers to play!
